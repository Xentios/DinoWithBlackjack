This is an overlay Pet that is being designed to work with Hearhtstone. Anybody can use this in anyway they like.

 The vision for the project:

    Hook to deck tracker or get logs directly so Pet actually interacts with the player based on game events.

    The pet helps you when playing the game , for example warns you when you have lethal.

    Get a copy of the background from the game so it fits to the background perfectly.

    Position itself automatically to left corner.

    Make player interactions like feeding/petting/dancing etc..

    Gets invisible if it obstructs vision for cards or other Hs specific buttons.

    More pets, better animations, any QoL improvements you can think of.
